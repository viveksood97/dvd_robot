# Overview
Project is a part of 808X coursework wherein the aim is to get familiarized with the basic concepts of ROS.
Task: Modify the TurtleBot simulation from the lecture and implement a simple walker algorithm much like a Roomba robot vacuum cleaner. The robot should move forward until it reaches an obstacle (but not colliding), then rotate in place until the way ahead is clear, then move forward again and repeat. Select/Modify a Gazebo World that can quickly and frequently test this behavior (add sufficient obstacles and enclose with walls such that robot cannot escape into open, endless space).


# Dependencies
- Ubuntu 20.04
- ROS Noetic

## Building package via command-line
```
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
git clone https://github.com/viveksood97/beginner_tutorials
cd ../
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
catkin_make
```
## Run
1. Launch using launch file without string argument
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
roslaunch beginner_tutorials launchPubSub.launch
```
2. Launch using launch file with string argument
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
roslaunch beginner_tutorials launchPubSub.launch newString:=anyString
```
3. To change the string use the service: /change_string
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
rosservice call /change_string AnotherString
```
4. Launch using launch file with rosbag recording on
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
roslaunch beginner_tutorials launchPubSub.launch recordbag:=true
```
## Output
The rqt_console and rqt_logger_level output

### Inspecting TF Frames
After launching both nodes using launch file, inspect the TF frames using tf_echo and rqt_tf_tree (Open a new Terminal)

```
rosrun tf tf_echo /world /talk
```
To genereate a pdf of tf frame
```
rosrun tf view_frames
```
To view the tf tree
```
rosrun rqt_tf_tree rqt_tf_tree
```
### Run Test
Open a new Terminal
```
cd ~/catkin_ws
source ./devel/setup.bash
rostest beginner_tutorials launchTest.launch
```

## Run cppcheck and cpplint
Run cppcheck: Results are stored in `./results/cppcheck.txt` 
```
cppcheck --enable=all --std=c++11 -I include/ --suppress=missingIncludeSystem $( find . -name *.cpp) > results/cppcheck.txt 2>&1
```

Run cpplint: Results are stored in `./results/cpplint.txt`
```
cpplint $( find . -name \*.hpp -or -name \*.cpp) > results/cpplint.txt 2>&1
```
